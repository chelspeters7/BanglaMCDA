Multicriteria Decision Analysis of Freshwater Resource Management in Southwestern Bangladesh

# About
Decision analysis methods provide opportunities to explore alternatives for drinking water resources in impoverished, rural regions of developing countries. With varying success, southwestern Bangladesh communities currently use multiple drinking water sources, including rainwater harvesting (RWH), ponds, pond sand filters (PSF), managed aquifer recharge (MAR), and tubewells (TW). This study uses a variety of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to assess the probable success of these drinking water sources based on various technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. Data include an assortment of physical and social sources including interviews, surveys, and water quality measurements.  Additionally, the MCDA methods (multiple attribute value theory, analytic hierarchy process, ELECTRE I, and ELECTRE III) are informed by local, nongovernmental organization, and academic stakeholder preferences. Across all scenarios we find that RWH is the most likely to succeed as a reliable drinking water source in the region. Conversely, MAR is the least preferred alternative. Sensitivity analyses suggest a robust ranking order that is relatively insensitive to ill-defined model parameters across all criteria categories. This case study demonstrates how decision modeling and alternative assessment can be the first step to reaching sustainable solutions in complex water management problems.
